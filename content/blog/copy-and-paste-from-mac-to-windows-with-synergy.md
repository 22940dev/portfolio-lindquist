I've been streaming more and more using a Mac for development and making
music while using the PC for handling all the streaming. I was getting
tired of switching back and forth between 2 mice and 2 keyboards, so
I went looking for a solution. I'd heard of Synergy many years ago,
but I hadn't really bothered giving it a serious look until today.

I'm really blown away by how seamlessly everything works. If you're in the
same scenario I'm in, it's definitely worth the $40 price tag.

Here's a quick video of synergy in action. The copy/paste feature really
is amazing.
