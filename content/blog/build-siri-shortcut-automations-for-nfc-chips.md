My NFC chips arrived in the mail today. I bought these ones from Amazon (I don't know if there's a "best" chip):

I figured I use the afternoon to figure out how to hook them into Siri Shortcuts to see if I could make anything useful. I was able to easily use them to log food in my food tracking app [LoseIt!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lose-it-calorie-counter/id297368629).

I also used the "webhook" approach to have it ping the [https://icanhazdadjoke.com/](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) API and speak out a joke.

## Note

You'll need an iPhone Xs or later for this to work. I tried this on
my wife's iPhone X, and there is no "NFC" option.
