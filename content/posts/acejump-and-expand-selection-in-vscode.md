[AceJump](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7086-acejump) is my favorite tool that I've ever made. I'm pretty sure the idea existed before I made it, but I wasn't aware of those solutions and all of the ideas came from my own brain. I've been super happy to see all the ideas validated over the years and across product lines.

Sadly, I don't get to use AceJump that much in my own products. The way the cursor flies around the screen would be too hard for an audience to follow in workshops and videos. This unfortunately means I've fallen out of the habit of using my creation. :/

The AceJump varient I found for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) works pretty well. So I thought I'd make a lesson about it to show it off. It's called [Code Ace Jumper](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lucax88x.codeacejumper).
