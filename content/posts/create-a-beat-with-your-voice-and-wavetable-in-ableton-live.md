Wavetable can be used for a whole lot more than simply selecting a 
wavetable preset. You can drag any sample onto the wavetable and
use it to generate music. This includes recording your own voice.

Once you get your wavetable in there, you'll want to be able to control
exactly how the oscillator will scrub through your wavetable and play it
how you want it. This video will walk you through using a sample you record and tweaking the LFOs to play the wavetable the way you want.
