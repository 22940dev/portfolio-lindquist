I've always been a little scared of zsh. Probably because JavaScript and [writing
cli tools in node.js](http://localhost:8000/create-command-line-tools-with-nodejs/)
 has always been easier and more comfortable for me.

 I ran into a situation where I needed to pass arguments into zsh so that I could forward them on to a node script, so I decided to take a day to really dive in and figure out how to make proper zsh functions. You can see the result in the video below.
